# LVGL Simulator Build Status

## ‚úÖ Completed
- SDL display and input working
- LVGL 8.4 integrated and rendering
- Build system configured to compile OSD sources
- All component include paths added
- ESP-IDF logging stubs created
- NVS storage stubs created
- GPIO stubs created
- Basic FreeRTOS headers created

## ‚ö†Ô∏è In Progress
Currently blocked on: FreeRTOS semaphore/mutex implementation

The build is compiling OSD source files but needs:
- `StaticSemaphore_t` type definition
- `xSemaphoreCreateMutexStatic()` function
- `xSemaphoreTake()` function  
- `xSemaphoreGive()` function
- `portMAX_DELAY` constant

## üîß Next Steps

### Option 1: Stub Out Mutex Component
Simplest - just make mutex operations no-ops for simulator:
```c
// In esp_stubs.h
typedef struct { int dummy; } StaticSemaphore_t;
#define xSemaphoreCreateMutexStatic(x) ((void*)1)
#define xSemaphoreTake(x,y) pdTRUE
#define xSemaphoreGive(x) pdTRUE
#define portMAX_DELAY 0xFFFFFFFF
```

### Option 2: Exclude Mutex Component
Modify CMakeLists.txt to not compile mutex.c

### Option 3: Full FreeRTOS Stubs
Create complete FreeRTOS stub library (significant effort)

## üìä Progress
- Build system: 95% complete
- ESP-IDF stubs: 60% complete  
- FreeRTOS stubs: 20% complete
- Component integration: 40% complete

## üéØ Recommendation

For fastest path to working simulator:
1. Add FreeRTOS mutex stubs (5 minutes)
2. Continue fixing compilation errors as they appear
3. Stub out hardware-specific components as needed

Estimated time to working build: 30-60 minutes of iterative fixing

## üöÄ Alternative: Use Mock UI

The mock UI in `chromatic_test.c` already works and shows your menu structure.
For UI design work, this may be sufficient without full device code integration.
