## Unreleased - PSRAM Development Branch

### Added (In Development - Not Production Ready)
- FPGA PSRAM read/write interface via QSPI
- Separate SPI device handle for PSRAM to prevent LVGL interference
- Console commands: `psram_256`, `psram_diag` for testing
- FPGA debug register monitoring at 0xFF00
- Comprehensive diagnostic tools for FPGA debugging

### Changed (Development)
- Disabled power manager task during PSRAM debugging
- Added 10ms workaround delay for FPGA FIFO clearing
- CS timing optimized (cs_ena_posttrans = 255)

### Known Issues (Development)
- **CRITICAL**: FPGA read data path disconnected - returns debug register value instead of PSRAM data
- FPGA FIFO not clearing on CS rising edge (workaround in place)
- PSRAM functionality blocked pending FPGA data path fix

### Technical Details
See `docs/PSRAM.md` for complete debugging findings and technical implementation details.

---

## v0.13.4

### Note
The FPGA must be updated to v18.7 or newer for fixed sprite palette behavior

### Changed
- Fixed bug where sprite palettes are not set correctly when using palette
selection tab.

## v0.13.3

### Note
The FPGA must be updated to v18.6 or newer for palette selection and updated
frame blending behavior.

### Added
- The ability to change the color palette for non-GBC titles through a Palette tab.

### Changed
- Renamed the frame blending toggle button text to "1:1" from "3:1" to clarify
the updated FPGA approach.
- Added redundancy to two-option menu widgets. Press B to toggle previous choice.
- Added up/down roll over to bottom/top for OSD navigation.

## v0.13.2

### Added
- The ability to mock button to the FPGA.

### Changed
- Simplified the firmware version reported the system tab. Press A to see details.

## v0.13.0

### Added
- Option to ignore diagonal inputs from the D-Pad
- Option to use the background palette 0 color (prevents screen transition flashing)
- Option to set low battery icon display behavior
- Added message to brightness to indicate low power mode is active
- Added hot keys to the Controls tab

### Changed
- Tuned battery voltage thresholds for 1.2V NiMH AA's
- Prevent backlight adjustments when in low power mode
- Renamed 'USB Color Correction' menu option to 'Streaming'
- Redesigned Controls tab, toggle option text

## v0.12.3

### Note
The FPGA must be updated to v17.0 or newer as the underlying communication protocol changed.

## Added
- Sleep the MCU on power up to reduce power consumption.
- Support LiPo battery thresholds and charging indication in the battery menu.

## Fixed
- Highest brightness setting is not properly restored on power up.
- Hot key brightness adjustments are saved between power cycles

### Changed
- Supports updated UART protocol.

## Removed
- The Frame Blending text hint on the Display screen.

## v0.11.2
This is the first production release.
